# Search Engine POC

The Search Engine is a proof-of-concept project that demonstrates the use of Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) Generative AI capabilities to build a search engine for Orange. The search engine leverages Orange's public technical documentation to provide users with an efficient and intuitive way to search for relevant information.

## Features

- Search functionality: Users can enter keywords or phrases to search for specific information within Orange's public documentation.
- Relevant results: The search engine employs GCP's Generative AI capabilities to analyze and understand the context of the search query, ensuring that the most relevant information is presented to the user.
- User-friendly interface: The project includes a user interface that offers a simple and intuitive search experience for users.
- Document indexing: The search engine indexes a subset of the Orange technical documentation available publicly, allowing for fast and accurate retrieval of information.

Orange technical files are stored on Google Cloud Storage, and the search widget is created using GCP's Gen App Builder.
